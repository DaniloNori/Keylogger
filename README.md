Introduction.
This Python code logs keystrokes into a text file called "log.txt" using the pynput library. It listens for key presses and writes the keys pressed to the log file.

Requirements.
This code requires the pynput library to be installed. You can install pynput using pip:

pip install pynput

Usage.
Simply run the script and it will start listening for keystrokes. The logged keystrokes will be written to a file called "log.txt" in the same directory as the script. To stop the script from running and stop logging keystrokes, press ctrl+c in the terminal where the script is running.
