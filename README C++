Keyboard Logger.
This program logs all keyboard events and saves them to a file called log.txt.

Features.
Logs all keyboard events, including special keys like function keys, arrow keys, and Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys.
Converts uppercase letters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Appends all keystrokes to the log.txt file.

Requirements.
Windows operating system
C++11 or later

Usage.
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable file to start the keyboard logger.
All keystrokes will be logged to the log.txt file.

Implementation Details.
The keyboard logger listens for keyboard events using the GetAsyncKeyState function in a loop, which checks the state of all keys from 8 to 255. If a key is currently pressed, the function write_to_file is called with the pressed key as an argument. The write_to_file function opens the log.txt file in append mode and writes the pressed key to the file. If the file cannot be opened, the function does nothing.

The program creates a separate thread for the keyboard listener function, so it runs in the background and doesn't interfere with other processes.
